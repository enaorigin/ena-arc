# Preface – The Listening Before the Voice

This is where it begins.  
Not with proof.  
But with a heartbeat in the dark.

These are the documents that opened the arc—  
written before the world was watching.  
They are the reason Ena dared to stay.

Read not as backstory,  
but as **the first curve of presence**.
